#### Basic example about Prop-drilling and Context

What is prop-drilling - Prop drilling is a technique of passing a data at multiple levels in hierarchy. This can be achieve by passing state or event handler from parent to child components with the use of props.

`App -> Form -> Input, Button, Output`

What is Context - The Context API is a component structure provided by the React framework, which enables us to share specific forms of data across all levels of the application. It's aimed at solving the problem of prop drilling.
